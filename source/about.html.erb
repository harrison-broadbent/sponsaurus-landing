        I'm building Sponsaurus to help newsletter creators manage & book ad
        space in their newsletters, without the hassle.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-xl mt-5 mx-auto text-left text-base text-gray-900">
        Here's the quick story -
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-xl mt-5 mx-auto text-left text-base text-gray-900">
        After reading heaps of email newsletters, I started noticing that lots
        of them were just using plain spreadsheets to manage all their
        advertising bookings.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-xl mt-5 mx-auto text-left text-base text-gray-900">
        I didn't think much of it at first, but it kept gnawing at me. After all
        the work creators do to produce their content, I figured that they
        deserved better tools. Why should creators have to build a ghetto
        advertising system, when they just want to produce great content?
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-xl mt-5 mx-auto text-left text-base text-gray-900">
        I set out in mid-2021 to build a better alternative, and here we are.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-xl mt-5 mx-auto text-left text-base text-gray-900">
        Thanks for joining me on the journey!
