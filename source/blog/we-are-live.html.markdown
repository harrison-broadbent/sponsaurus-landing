I'm very exited to launch the new marketing site for Sponsaurus!

Now that the main app is coming together, I decided it was time to overhaul the marketing site as well. It took much longer than I expected to get right, but I'm happy with the final product and I think it'll last a long time.

For those interested, I put this site together using -

- [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) (static site generator) to build the actual site.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the UI and styling.
- [Formspree](https://formspree.com) for any forms on the site.
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host the site.

Thanks for reading this far! Since you seem so keep, you might be interested in following along for more regular updates and behind-the-scenes stuff. There are two main ways to do that -

I'm most active on Twitter, and that's where I post very regular updates - [@hrrsnbbnt](https://twitter.com/hrrsnbbnt). You can also join the mailing list using the down below, to get product updates and information.
