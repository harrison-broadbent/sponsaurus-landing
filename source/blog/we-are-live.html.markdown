I'm very exited to launch the new marketing site for Sponsaurus!

Now that the main app is coming together, I figured it was time to overhaul the marketing site as well.

For those interested, I put this site together using -

- [Formspree](https://formspree.com) for any forms on the site.
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host the site.

Thanks for reading! Since you seem so keen, you might be interested in following along for more updates and behind-the-scenes stuff. There are two main ways to do that -

I'm most active on Twitter, and that's where I post regular updates - [@hrrsnbbnt](https://twitter.com/hrrsnbbnt). You can also join the mailing list down below, to get product updates and information.
