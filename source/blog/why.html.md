I'm building Sponsaurus to help newsletter creators manage & book ad space in their newsletters, without the hassle.

Here's the quick story -

After reading heaps of email newsletters, I started noticing that lots of them were just using plain spreadsheets to manage all their advertising bookings.

I didn't think much of it at first, but it kept gnawing at me. After all the work creators do to produce their content, I figured that they deserved better tools. **Why should creators have to build a ghetto advertising system, when they just want to produce great content?**

I set out in mid-2021 to build a better alternative, and here we are.
